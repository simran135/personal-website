I'm a rising Senior at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science majoring in Artificial Intelligence.  

On campus, I am an undergraduate researcher at [ACMI Lab](https://acmilab.org/people/simran-kaur/) and serve as head teaching assistant for 15-281 Artificial Intelligence Representation & Problem Solving.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, painting, and baking biscotti!
